# google-drive-upload
Process to upload images from local directory to cloud storage on Google Drive.

Google Drive API has a quick-start workflow to authorize client access as per:

https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/python

outside the scope of this project, so client running this program is assumed
to already be authorized.
